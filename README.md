JavaScript Code - Accordion, Sidebar, Modal, and Navigation

This JavaScript code provides functionality for an interactive web page with the following features:

Accordion: Allows expanding and collapsing content sections when clicked.
Sidebar: Toggles the visibility of a sidebar when a button is clicked.
Modal: Opens and closes a modal window when a button is clicked.
Navigation: Toggles the active state of navigation elements when clicked.
The code uses event listeners to handle user interactions and modify the CSS classes of the corresponding HTML elements to achieve the desired behavior.
This is the code for a webpage that displays a list of questions and answers in an accordion-style format. When a question is clicked, the corresponding answer is displayed below it. The code is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Getting Started
To use this code, follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository or download the HTML, CSS and Javascript files.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Dependencies
This code relies on the following external libraries:

Font Awesome (version 5.14.0): Used for icons.
Google Fonts: Used for the "Great Vibes," "Open Sans," and "Roboto" fonts.
Usage
Once the webpage is loaded in the browser, you will see a list of questions. Click on a question to reveal the corresponding answer. Click again to hide the answer.

The webpage is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes. On larger screens, the accordion and sidebar will adjust their width accordingly.

Structure
The code is organized as follows:

The HTML structure is contained within the <body> element.
The CSS styles are defined in the <style> block inside the <head> element.
The main content of the webpage is inside the <main> element.
The accordion sections are created using the <div> element with the class accordion.
Each section consists of a title (<div> with the class title) and the answer (<p> element).
The sidebar navigation is contained within the <aside> element with the class sidebarleft.
Customization
Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs. You can change the questions and answers by modifying the HTML content within the accordion sections. Additionally, you can customize the styles by modifying the CSS properties. Modify the code as needed to fit your project requirements. You can customize the class names, event listeners, and callback functions to match your HTML structure and desired functionality.

Please note that this code is provided as-is, and any modifications or updates are your responsibility.
